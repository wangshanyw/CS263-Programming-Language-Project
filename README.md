## Equivalence among 3 denotational semantics and small step semantics
---
### 1 Tasks and Progression
- [ ] A general theorem for proving equivalence between two recursively defined semantics
- [x] Equivalence among three recursively defined denotational semantics: the normal one, the one with time, and the one with traces
- [x] Equivalence between small step semantics and each of denotational semantics
### 2 Compilation for our work
- Compile `Imp.v`, `RTClosure.v`, `ImpExt.v`, `ImpCF.v` to found the environment
- Compile `Denotational_Semantics_2.v`,`Denotational_Semantics_3.v`,`Equivalence_Semantics_1.v` for further proof
### 3 Proof corresponding to files
- 3 definitions of denotational semantics
  - `Denotational_Semantics_1.v`: normal one
  - `Denotational_Semantics_2.v`: the one with time
  - `Denotational_Semantics_3.v`: the one with traces
- Equivalence between Small Steps Semantics and each of Denotational Semantics
  - `Equivalence_Semantics_1.v`: normal one
  - `Equivalence_Semantics_2.v`: the one with time
  - `Equivalence_Semantics_3.v`: the one with traces
